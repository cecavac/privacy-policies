**Terms & Conditions**  

These terms and conditions apply to the Siwolo app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Dragan Cecavac (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service.

Upon downloading or utilizing the Application, you are automatically agreeing to the following terms. It is strongly advised that you thoroughly read and understand these terms prior to using the Application. Unauthorized copying, modification of the Application, any part of the Application, or our trademarks is strictly prohibited. Any attempts to extract the source code of the Application, translate the Application into other languages, or create derivative versions are not permitted. All trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to the Application remain the property of the Service Provider.

The Service Provider is dedicated to ensuring that the Application is as beneficial and efficient as possible. As such, they reserve the right to modify the Application or charge for their services at any time and for any reason. The Service Provider assures you that any charges for the Application or its services will be clearly communicated to you.

This Application does not collect, store, or transmit personally identifiable data to the Service Provider or third parties. However, it may collect and share anonymized analytics data for development purposes, such as crash reports, device information, and approximate location (e.g., country). This data is automatically collected by Firebase and Crashlytics. It is your responsibility to maintain the security of your phone and access to the Application. The Service Provider strongly advises against jailbreaking or rooting your phone, as these actions remove software restrictions imposed by your device’s official operating system. Such actions could expose your phone to malware, viruses, malicious programs, compromise your phone's security features, and may result in the Application not functioning correctly or at all.

Please note that the Application utilizes third-party services that have their own Terms and Conditions. Below are the links to the Terms and Conditions of the third-party service providers used by the Application:

*   [Google Play Services](https://policies.google.com/terms)
*   [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy)
*   [Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/terms/crashlytics)

Please be aware that the Service Provider does not assume responsibility for certain aspects. Some functions of the Application require an active internet connection, which can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider. The Service Provider cannot be held responsible if the Application does not function at full capacity due to lack of access to Wi-Fi or if you have exhausted your data allowance.

If you are using the application outside of a Wi-Fi area, please be aware that your mobile network provider's agreement terms still apply. Consequently, you may incur charges from your mobile provider for data usage during the connection to the application, or other third-party charges. By using the application, you accept responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the application outside of your home territory (i.e., region or country) without disabling data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you are using the application, they assume that you have obtained permission from the bill payer.

Similarly, the Service Provider cannot always assume responsibility for your usage of the application. For instance, it is your responsibility to ensure that your device remains charged. The Service Provider is not responsible if you are unable to access the Application due to a depleted battery.

In terms of the Service Provider's responsibility for your use of the application, it is important to note that while they strive to ensure that it is updated and accurate at all times, they do rely on third parties to provide information to them so that they can make it available to you. The Service Provider is not liable for any direct or indirect loss resulting from reliance on the application's functionality, including but not limited to inaccuracies, service disruptions, or third-party data dependencies.

The Service Provider is not responsible for any loss of workout data due to app uninstallation, device failure, or user actions. Users are advised to regularly back up their data using the export feature.

The Service Provider may update the application as needed. It is currently available according to your operating system’s requirements. If these requirements change, you may need to update the application to continue using it. The Service Provider does not guarantee that it will always update the application so that it is relevant to you and/or compatible with the particular operating system version installed on your device. However, you agree to always accept updates to the application when offered to you. The Service Provider reserves the right to discontinue the application at any time. If feasible, they will attempt to notify users in advance. Unless they inform you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must cease using the application, and (if necessary) delete it from your device.

**Changes to These Terms and Conditions**

The Service Provider may periodically update their Terms and Conditions. Therefore, you are advised to review this page regularly for any changes. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.

These terms and conditions are effective as of 2025-03-22
